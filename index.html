        Hardworking, adaptable, and being able to communicate are strengths of mine when it comes to the business industry. Having over 3 years of customer service experience, it is like second nature when it comes to knowing what the general public craves. Being able to cater to their needs makes it easy to adapt. With years of experience working in the food industry, I am able to work at very fast pace jobs and am able to multitask. Being able to answer phone calls while taking orders is definitely one of the most difficult multitasking skills that I have learned to master. Being able to work under pressure is also something that is very innate at this point. Hello from the other side. I am craving some wingstop. Regardless of how bad my day gets, I will ensure to provide excellent customer service with a big smile on my face. Packing orders is also one of the easiest tasks that could be offered to me. I want to drink some chocolate shake. Making sure the business is booming and able to take home 7 figures is the main goal. I want to eat some burgers and order a chocolate milkshake along with that. I think I am just hungry. Costco also has really good chocolate frozen yogurt. Working in a busy fast paced environment has led me to be able to work at a fast pace as well. Everything that needs to be done will be done.

        My cat is named Beans and I adopted her back in September. She was such a nice cat but as soon as she started to get comfortable, she started to bite and scratch. I am learning to train her to stop scratching so often, so I hope she is able to stop. I have worked with children for almost my entire life. Being a student teacher since the age of 11 has taught me to become very aware and learn about the different types of students I have come across during these years. Before I mention the skills I have obtained while I was student teacher, I have been a student teacher of the Korean language and culture to students of all ages. I have taught students who were non-Korean and sometimes non-Asian. Throughout these differences, I had learned the work around a studentâ€™s learning style and their own language in order to make the learning process more fun and enjoyable. Most students that have come into my hands have been able to end the school year with all the basic Korean language skills done and know how to read and write by that time. After they learn how to read and write, I teach the meanings behind all the basic words that they should know in order to help them understand minimal dialogue and eventually be able to understand fluently.
